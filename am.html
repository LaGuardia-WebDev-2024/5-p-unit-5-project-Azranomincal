    <h1> Dark Stories...</h1>
   <p id="story">
     Mr McNutt was a 33-year-old army veteran who had seen active service in Iraq, and subsequently dealt with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental-health issues.

He had recently broken up with his girlfriend and had been drinking on the night of his death. He was talking about suicide and arguing with people who were trying to comfort him. At some point the police turned up outside his apartment.

More than 200 people were watching the stream when he died, including Mr Steen and several of his friends.
